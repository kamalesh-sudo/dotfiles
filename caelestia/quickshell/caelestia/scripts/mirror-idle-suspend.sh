# Nexus still suspended at KDE's default 10 minutes on battery, with nothing on
# screen to say a second timer existed.
#
# Only the profiles that answer "how long may the machine idle" are touched. The
# low battery profile is left alone on purpose: it exists to get the machine to
# sleep before the battery dies, not to express an idle preference.
#
# Usage: mirror-idle-suspend.sh <seconds>. 0 means Caelestia does not own the
# suspend timeout and KDE's own timers are left as they are.
